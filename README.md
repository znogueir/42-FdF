<br>

Goal(s) : 
- code a program that displays a specific file format as a 3d wireframe
<br>

Features :
- isometric wireframe view (mandatory)
- basic user interface (bonus)
- 3D rotations (bonus)
- multiple colored height maps, including scales and a linear gradient. (bonus)
- zoom -/+ (bonus)
- variable height ratio (bonus)
<br>

Concept(s) learned :
- using a simple graphic library
- bresenham's algorithm
- managing keyboard inputs (bonus)
- 3D rotations formulas (bonus)
- linear interpolation (mapping height to color gradient) (bonus)
- bit manipulation for rgb channels (bonus)
